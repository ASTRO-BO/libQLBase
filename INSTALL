This library uses cmake >= 2.6 to build, check if you have it installed!
The installation works only for linux by now.

You can build the system in-sources or out-of-sources. The latter is suggested
and it is for example in the home:

  ~ $ mkdir build
  ~ $ cd build
  ~/build $ cmake libQLBase/src
  ~/build $ make

To install into /usr/local just use:

  ~/build $ su
    ..type root password..
  ~/build # make install
  ~/build # exit

To clean the temporary local build simply use:

  ~/build $ cd ..
  ~/ $ rm -rf build/

If you want specify a different installation path you need to change the
MAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX cmake variable, like:

  ~/build $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/LOCAL_GTB libQLBaseDir/
