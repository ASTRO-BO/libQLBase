This library uses cmake 2.8 to build, check if you have it installed!
The installation works only for linux by now.

You can build the system out-of-sources like this:
(for this example the sources are in ~/Projects/libQLBase)

  ~ $ mkdir build
  ~ $ cd build
  ~/build $ cmake ~/Projects/libQLBase/
  ~/build $ make

To install into /usr/local just use:

  ~/build $ su
    ..type root password..
  ~/build # make install
  ~/build # exit

To clean the temporary local build simply use:

  ~/build $ cd ..
  ~/ $ rm -rf build/

If you want specify a different installation directory use the same process just described.
You need only to specify an additional parameter on the cmake call (CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX):

  ~/build $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/installdir ~/Projects/libQLBase/
